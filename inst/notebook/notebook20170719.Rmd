My attempts to build bamr have been unsuccessful. Now trying without code in zzz.R. I think this means that I am only able to use R (and not Stan) functionality here. At least now I can evaluate my tests. 


That's done, for now. Next see if it works on Po data using manual stan implementation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(rstan)

mod1 <- stan_model("../../exec/man_amhg.stan")
```

### Some time later...

**Finally** got the package to compile! Issue was *stupid*:

- devtools decides whether a package needs to be compiled by checking the last-modified time of its files. Because I had (somehow) modified bamr.so *after* Makevars, Makevars.win, and/or init.cpp, devtools didn't think I had code that needed to be compiled. Not sure how bamr.so would have gotten modified though...

Time to merge this branch
