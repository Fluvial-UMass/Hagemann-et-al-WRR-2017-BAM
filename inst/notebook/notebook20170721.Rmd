Still going with package devel. Having trouble installing from github.

- Make postprocessing functions
- Write tests
- See why not installing from github.

### Checking out bayesplot package.

```{r}
library(bayesplot)
ls("package:bayesplot")
```

Several sets of plotting functions, as laid out in the vignettes.

- `ppc_` functions, for posterior prediction checks
- `mcmc_` functions for parameter estimates from MCMC draws, as well as diagnostics

The most immediately useful for me are the parameter draws, as laid out in the [MCMC vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bayesplot/vignettes/MCMC.html). I'll now try some.

```{r}
posterior <- as.array(est1)

dim(posterior)
dimnames(posterior)[["parameters"]]
mcmc_intervals(posterior, pars = paste0("b[", 1:10, "]"))
```
